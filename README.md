#QuadRotor Simulation and Control


As an alternative to Matlab, I am using the Python Control Library [2]. Although the book [] I am using presents code in Matlab, Matlab has a price (which is worth it) that I cannot afford. Also I am comfortable with python. 

I got inspiration on how to model the (otherwise written in paper) systems in Python from

Which is also the webpage for an excellent Control Systems book[3]
